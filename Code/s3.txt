 Some day, I know...  I can faintly see a day approaching through the
haze of time, coming to me, coming for us, bringing us together forever.  I
call through the endless span of time, and I can barely hear a whisper
coming back, saying softly, "Yes, James.  I hear you, and I want you to know
this: There is a day in the future...  Hold on to your hopes, because it will
come, as surely as the Sun rises across the morning sky and warms the cold,
dark Earth... we will meet again, and Summer will be the season of the rest of
our lives."  Her apparition appears before me, shockingly, and she winks an
eye and smiles before gradually fading away.  I know that I will keep trying
to reach her, until old age robs me of my gifts, until these bones of mine
wither to dust.
